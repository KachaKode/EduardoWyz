Tasks to be completed for this project:

-Steering a flock member using keyboard or mouse. Allow a user to control a single agent using either keyboard or mouse interaction. This will require having an agent specified that is considered the agent being controlled.

- Adversarial agents. Allow a subset of agents to be considered adversarial agents. They will be more interested in attacking other agents rather than the flocking rules.

- Life or agent status. Allow the agent's life to vary depending on how far it's traveled, if it's surrounded by too many other flock members, it's being attacked, or collides. The status of the agent can reduce or grow depending on rules you set up. Display the status (visually) for each agent.


-Collision detection and resolution with the environment blocked areas.
